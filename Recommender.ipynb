    "The w2v_model refers to a Word2Vec model, which is a popular approach for learning word embeddings from large text corpora. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space, where words with similar meanings or contexts are closer to each other in that space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific code, the w2v_model is loaded using the api.load() function from the gensim.downloader module. The model being loaded is \"glove-wiki-gigaword-50\". GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining word embeddings, and the \"glove-wiki-gigaword-50\" model is trained on a combination of the Wikipedia text and the Gigaword dataset. It has word embeddings of dimensionality 50, meaning each word is represented by a 50-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the w2v_model is loaded, it is used to obtain word embeddings for words encountered during the text processing stage. In the get_sentiment_embedding function, each word in the preprocessed text is passed to the w2v_model using w2v_model[word]. This retrieves the word embedding vector associated with that word from the loaded Word2Vec model.\n",
    "The obtained word embeddings are then used in combination with sentiment scores to calculate the overall sentiment embedding of the text. For each word, the sentiment score is calculated using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the NLTK library. The sentiment score captures the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of the word. The sentiment score is multiplied element-wise with the corresponding word embedding, and the resulting vectors are averaged to obtain the overall sentiment embedding of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the w2v_model is a pre-trained Word2Vec model that provides word embeddings, and it is used in the code to obtain word embeddings for words encountered in the input text. These word embeddings, along with sentiment scores, are then used to calculate the overall sentiment embedding of the text."
